Transformer are usually used in NLP. In computer vision, attention is used with CNN as a part of it. But the paper **An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale** shows that pure transformer can perform well in image classification. This is a PyTorch implementation of the project.
