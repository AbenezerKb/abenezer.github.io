# Hello, ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Abenezer. I've been working as a software engineer for more than 3 years. Currently I'm studying my Master's at AIMS(African Institute for Mathematical Sciences) Senegal on AMMI program and I have interest in doing research on **Representation Learning**, and **Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning**. I'm available for research collaboration and open source projects. Shot me an email if you're interested in working together.

# About Me

I'm a born again Christian. I was born and raised in Ethiopia. I usually love to engage myself with church activities. Besides that I usually spend my time working on tech projects, mostly on ML, and love to explore Computer Science related research papers. Stay tuned for personal and professional updates!
